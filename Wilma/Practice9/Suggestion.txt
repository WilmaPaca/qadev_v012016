Define which code guideline you would suggest for :
****************************************
Format (int, float, string)->

The format for the variables is necesary to puts .to_s/ *.to_i/ *.to_/*.to_f when it uses us enter  values or manage us datas with operations greather. my purpose is 

E.g.
@name = name.to_string
@@number = number.to_int
countSeconds = seconds.to_f

*********************************************
Classes
When we perform code is necesary to have a structure and format. My purpose is:

E.g.
=begin
It is necesary to have comments to know the class and its purpose
=end

class Example

	def method
	
	end

end

**********************************************
Methods
The methods when it uses parameters is better to puts () to understand its sequence, my purpose is:
E.g.
	def method (name, number)
	@name = name.to_string
	numberTelf = number.to_i
	
	end


*********************************************
Variables, Getter/Setter
The variables Getter/Setter should be with a format to elimiante doubts in the code when others people review it.
I consider It is possible to perform it better, below there is a example

class Clothe
# method that gets the value of @color
  def color
    @color
  end
 
# method that sets the value of @color
 def color(str)
   @color = str.to_s
 end
end

clothe = Clothe.new
# you are setting the color changing the @color to "Blue"
clothe.color = "Blue"
*********************************************
If condition

The conditions  should be to manage with a format to eliminate doubts with another people or partners. My purspose is:
E.g.

if ( a == b)

end

or

if a == b
	#the operations should be to perform with 	space.
	puts "This is my example"
end
