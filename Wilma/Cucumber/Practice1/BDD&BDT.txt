Research :
1. When and why BDD was defined
(Behavior Driven development)BDD could be defined when a developer and either the Agile product owner or a business analyst sit down together and write pending specs.

Because this focused/defined on the business behaviors your code is implementing: the “why” behind the code. 


2. The most important aspects of BDD

3. Why is useful and when could be applied.
	Because BDD begins with the business goal.
	It can be applied to execute simple-text functional 	specifications as automated tests.

4. Which type of teams could implement BDD
	Stakeholder
	Developer

5. Structure of a feature – Give an example
	A feature is captured as a “story”, which defines the 	scope of the feature along with its acceptance criteria.

	Feature: Searching by keyword

	  In order to find items that I would like to purchase
 	 As a potential buyer
 	 I want to be able to search for items containing certain 	words

  	Scenario: Should list items related to a specified keyword
  	  Given I want to buy a wool scarf
   	 When I search for items containing 'wool'
    	Then I should only see items related to 'wool'


6. Structure of a user story – Give an example
	Title (one line describing the story)
 
	Narrative:
	As a [role]
	I want [feature]
	So that [benefit]

Story: Account Holder withdraws cash
 
As an Account Holder
I want to withdraw cash from an ATM
So that I can get money when the bank is closed

7. Structure of a scenario – Give an example
	Scenario 1: Title
	Given [context]
	  And [some more context]...
	When  [event]
	Then  [outcome]
 	 And [another outcome].

Scenario 1: Account has sufficient funds
Given the account balance is \$100
 And the card is valid
 And the machine contains enough money
When the Account Holder requests \$20
Then the ATM should dispense \$20
 And the account balance should be \$80
 And the card should be returned



8. Differences between BDD and BDT
	BDD is an agile testing methodology. 
	BDT - Behavior driven testing, usually come after /during 	BDD  but is not a must, it can be organized with 	traditional testing as well.
